# Notes.: regex to match the password failures messages in the logfile. The
# host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
# be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
# (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values: TEXT

# Asterisk 1.8 uses Host:Port format which is reflected here
